* Introduction

* Motivation - Overcommitment
Memory as a hard resource. Importance of overcommit.

* Page Sharing
Survey of everything. Some history?
** Scanning vs Disk based sharing
2 competing approaches.

* KSM
Diagram of operations, history, and some implementation details
Focus on generic nature
** Exp 1: KSM effectiveness
Small experiment which shows that KSM shares large % of same pages. Done earlier in fingerprinting project.
Expected result : > 90% sharing of KSM, so good enough.
Reason : establish some ground truths: KSM _works_ .
Setup : Random workload (doesnt matter) and take fingerprint and see KSM shar% . Run with 1,2,3 VMs.

* Analysis of shared pages
** By flag
** Exp 2: Pages shared by flag type
Run some benchmarks (static VMs just booted up ; Kernbench ; HTTP-perf) and see what kinds of pages are shared by flag type.
Reason: establish some ground truths : sharing is _feasible_ . Also answer : what _kinds_ of pages are shared?
Setup: (1,2,3,5) VMs with different OS running same benchmarks. (diff VMs ; same kernel ; same /var/www) 

** Exp 2.1 : KSM with no pagecache pages
Run KSM but skip all guest pagecache pages.

** Exp 3: Page sharing over time
Run some benchmarks and record pages shared over the duration of benchmark. Also record *KSM overhead*.
Reason: Show that KSM overhead is significant enough, thus implying the need for some optimizations.
Setup: (2) VMs running benchmarks. KSM being profiled using perf.

* Lookahead optimization
** Tracing
** Implementation and analysis
(log u etc)
** Results
** Exp 4: Lookahead success
Run benchmarks on VMs (1,2,3) to on and record lookahead successes. Also record *KSM overhead*
*Compare vanilla KSM overhead with lookahead-optimization*


** Exp 5: Substrings in shared-map.
Record consecutive pages being shared in some benchmarks.
Reason : justify why lookahead works.
Setup: tracedump analysis simple python script

* Problem of double-caching
** Existing approaches 
Geiger, that hypervisor memory thing, etc.
** Importance of exclusive caches.
** Exp 6: Memory savings with exclusive caches
How many pages are there in both places?
Setup : Benchmarks on VMs.

** Exp 7: Overhead of ksm-exclusive-cache
Run benchmarks on VMs to record KSM overhead (with ex cache)
Reason : scanning vast host page cache could be significant overhead.Also savings might help.

Some caching theory references.

* KSM-implementation of double-caching
** Implementation and analysis
** Results
Fig7: Number of pages evicted out due to duplicates
Fig8: Overhead of cache eviction

* Qualitative survey of dynamic memory management for VMs.
** Exp 8: Memory mountains
Look at this problem like L1/2 cache , and build mem-mountains in these cases:
(normal ; no guest cache ; no host cache ; swap as ramdisk )
Setup : could use IOZone or randal bryant's simple program.
Reason : Demonstrate the latencies/throughput of various caches. 
*This depends on lots of factors like IO schedulers, FS, virtual disk layout etc. Do for any one, for now.*

** Tmem: cleancache, ramszwap, etc.
** Collab2
** Ballooning and Hotplug
