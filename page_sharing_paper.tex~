Improving memory management in Virtual environments using Page Sharing
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-2}

Memory is one of the important physical resources in virtualized environments. Virtualization enables us to run multiple Operating Systems (one in each Virtual Machine) on a single physical machine. One of the key drivers of Virtual hosting and cloud computing is the ability of hypervisors to overcommit resources. That is, Virtual machines are given resources in excess of what is actually available.
In this report, we consider the problem of memory overcommitment, since we believe that memory is almost always the resource with the most contention. Unlike CPU and network, memory is non-renewable. Moreover, the optimality of it's allocation is critical because of the non-linear nature of the penalty , in the form of expensive, disk-seek-laden page-faults. 

Our contributions are 2 fold: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We describe a set of improvements to KSM content-based-page-sharing, and show their impact on performance with microbenchmarks and some real-world workloads.
\item We show that the page-sharing infrastructure is a powerful tool for improving memory management in the host and guests. Here, we make 2 important contributions:
\item We use page-sharing infrastructure to implement an exclusive page-cache. That is, the host and guest page caches do not have the same content.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Motivation}
\label{sec-3}

One of the benefits of virtualization is that it permits overcommitment of physical resources. This works because servers are typically woefully underutilized. This works ideally for overcommiting CPU and networking resources. However, the total memory in a system is fixed, and Guest operating systems expect to be able access all the memory they `see' at boot-time. [hotswap and pluggable memory will be discussed later].
Overcommiting memory is thus an important tool if we seek to improve server consolidation. 
While CPU,network usage on idle workloads can be exploited to increase the number of VMs running on a physical machine because they are inherently shared resources and operating systems and processes are aware of their shared nature. Kernels ofcourse do not expect their physical memory (of the machine) to belong to someone else. 
Furthermore, memory is seldom `idle' or free. Operating systems make all effort to make full use of available physical memory. Even if the system working set isnt large enough, the rest of the memory is going to be used for caching files and other IO data. 
One approach is implementing the same virtual memory abstraction that processes are forced to use. 
The only difference is that the OS kernel is the process, and the hypervisor pages out/in guest physical memory. The disadvantages of this approach are several, as highlighted in [waldspurger].

Furthermore, the traditional memory-management techniques(paging) and infrastructure(page-caches, LRU lists, etc) do not ideally fit into the virtual setup. 

Hypervisor memory management typically uses user-inputs and heuristics to allocate memory to guests. Paging and Ballooning provide for dynamism. However both these approaches are invasive and do not faithfully provide a reasonable approximation to the actual physical system.

Current VMMs have no way of knowing which page to swap out. Bigger performance problems arise when both the host and the guest swap out the page. In this case even the guest swapout will incur 2 IO accesses.
  
\subsection{Why sharing}
\label{sec-3_1}

working set
One of the ways of implementing memory overcommit is memory sharing. If 2 VMs could transparently share memory, then the total used machine memory would reduce.
There are two major approaches to sharing : COW, CBPS. 
In this work we focus on CBPS. CBPS is more general and transparent to the VMs. 
\subsection{Other overcommitment approaches}
\label{sec-3_2}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Transcendent memory
\item CleanCache
\item zCache
\item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{KernelMapped: This includes kernel text+data+stack, as well as any}
\label{sec-7_1}

other memory region not available to guest user processes. This includes
memory reserved by BIOS, DMA, other kernel buffers etc. 
These pages are sharable to a large extent, because typically
stable/longterm kernels tend to be used, specially in enterprise
workloads. 
However, sharing pages belonging to guest kernel may be a security
issue[ksmsecurity].
Also since the amount of kernel memory is small, the tradeoff between
increasing memory sharing and the associated security risks seems to
tilt in favour of not sharing kernel memory regions.
\subsubsection{Anonymous}
\label{sec-7_2}
\subsubsection{Mapped}
\label{sec-7_3}
\subsubsection{PageCache}
\label{sec-7_4}

We claim that pagecache pages should not be shared between VMs. By
their very nature, contents of pagecache pages are ephemeral and just
a cache for files on disk. Pagecache pages are also dropped first
under memory pressure, and thus form a `true' cache. Under the
current, default KSM+KVM settings, a very large amount of pages shared
are infact belong to the guest pagecache. This inflates the sharing
ratio, and we argue that this sharing is `meaningless' and brings very
limited performance gains. The inflation of sharing ratio also
witholds the real status of memory consumption in the system
(host+guests).

Consider a scenario where a large number of pages are reported to be
shared, thus increasing the amount of free memory available in the
system.
A guest VM, under memory pressure, will simply drop the clean
pagecache pages, and replace them with mapped/anonymous pages
belonging to some process address space. 
This incurs a COW cost for all the guests involved (whoever's
pagecache pages were being shared with each other). 
A provisioning/placement tool, or an administrator might be
led into making a wrong provisioning decision based on the inflated
free memory it sees. 
This problem is compounded by the fact that typicaly, the linux kenel
tends to use almost all available memory for it's pagecache, so the
amount of cached pages are often quite large (about 40\% of total
memory on most workloads). 

We have thus far argued that sharing cached pages does not help
increase overcommit, and instead skews memory numbers. 
The disadvantages of sharing cache pages becomes even more apparent
when we consider their sharing cost. 
Since KSM (or any CBPS for that matter) essentially runs an O(nlogn)
algorithm for detecting and implementing sharing, any reduction in n
is significant. And since cache pages are a large fraction of n, the
saving in KSM overhead will be significant. 
The KSM overhead typically ranges between 5-15\% (CPU) , which is not
insignificant.
With our modifications, we bring it down, while maintaining effective
page sharing. 
\subsubsection{Free}
\label{sec-7_5}
\section{Comparison}
\label{sec-4}

Page sharing in hypervisors can be broadly classified into 2 categories: Scanning based approaches, which periodically scan the memory areas of all VMs and perform comparisons to detect identical pages. 
Usually,a hash based fingerprint is used to identify likely duplicates, and then the duplicate pages are unmapped from all the PTEs they belong to, being replaced by a single merged page.
Examples of this are the vmware ESX server page sharing implementation (which was the first page sharing implementation i know of), Difference Engine, which performs very aggressive duplicate detection and even works at the sub-page level, in addition to introducing compression for `old pages'. KSM also falls in this category.

The other extreme is page sharing using paravirtualized support. Here , the virtual/emulated disk abstraction is used to implement page sharing at the device level itself. Examples are satori.

Our modifications to KSM bridge the gap between the general-purpose but CPU intensive scanners and the paravirtualized but low-overhead disk-based page sharers.



No VM modifications - can as well read off /proc. 
General approach
No changes to IO stack unlike [satori], [disco], [xenfs], [ventana]
reduce KSM overhead
sharing remains same
\section{Page Sharing}
\label{sec-5}

Content based page sharing [carl],[],[] is a useful technique for
memory overcommit. Total physical memory available is a hard
constraint, and increasing the percieved amount of memory in the
system is useful .
CBPS solutions operate by scanning VM memory regions, looking for
pages matching in content. 
Memory contents are dynamic, and thus are page contents as well.
Content of a page can change any time, and any CBPS solution must
account for this and prevent illegal sharing. Illegal sharing is akin
to mapping the wrong physical page to an address space of a process,
something which is a fundamental task of Operating Systems.
\section{KSM}
\label{sec-6}

KSM (Kernel Samepage Merging) is a scanning based CBPS tool. KSM is a kernel-thread which runs on the host system and periodically scans guest VM memory regions looking for identical pages.
Once two pages are found to be the same, they are replaced by a single KSM page. This new page is COW protected.
For detecting identical pages, KSM uses a red-black tree of pages. Each node is a page, and the nodes are ordered according to the page contents. This guarantees an O(log(n)) search+insert for pages.
KSM maintains 2 search-trees. The stable tree and the unstable tree. Each page which belongs to a region registered with KSM can be one of 3 states:
Present in stable tree
Present in unstable tree
Not present in any tree

The unstable tree is used for page comparison within a single pass, and is destroyed after the completion of a pass. The reason is that the pages in the unstable tree are not write-protected, and are inserted into the tree based on their content at the time of insertion. Once a page has been inserted, its contents may change. This approach leads to false-negatives. There are no false positives in KSM, because pages are locked and COWed upon sharing. If an attempt to write a KSM page is made, the sharing is immediately broken.

The number of pages in a system can be quite large, and thus even the unstable tree may get prohibitively large and difficult to maintain and search. To alliveate this problem, KSM does not insert frequently changing pages (volatile pages) into the unstable tree. These pages are thus untracked.
To determine volatility, a checksum (jhash2) is used to compare the page contents with the previous KSM scan iteration. If the page checksum has changed between scans, it is deemed volatile and we move onto the next page.

This process goes on repeatedly, and thus has a consistant impact on the performance of the system. KSM typically consumes between 10-20\% CPU on a single CPU core. 
\section{Mem Layout}
\label{sec-7}

The key insight of this document/report is that not all pages are the
same. KSM, which in the virtualization context shares identical memory
regions between VMs, at present treats all pages as equal. 

A breakup of pages being shared by their flags is given below:
.\ldots{}

QEMU allocates a large contiguous memory region (of the host) as the
guest RAM.

For our discussion, we will classify pages into the following
categories:
Kernel-mapped
Anonymous
Mapped/FileBacked
PageCache+other caches (inode etc)
Free Pages

We will now look at each category, and give reasons/justifications for
sharing/not sharing pages in a particular category. In the future
sections, we seek to give experimental justifications of our claims.
\section{Sharing Model}
\label{sec-8}

In this section we describe a general model for evaluating pagesharing
performance. 
The goal of any CBPS mechanism is to share as many number of pages as
possible, with the least possible overhead. 

Minimize \{Unshared$_{\mathrm{Pages}}$ + Scanning$_{\mathrm{cost}}$ + Sharing$_{\mathrm{cost}}$ + COW$_{\mathrm{cost}}$\}

A suitably small granularity `t' is required. 

Below we describe what an ideal sharing mechanism should be like:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shareable pages at time t should be merged.
\item Pages sharable at t but unshareable at t+epsilon should not be
   merged. In this case the COW cost + merge cost outweighs the
   benefit of any traniently free memory.
\item Number of comparisons is minimal. Obviously, under standard
   assumptions, it is not possible to know exactly when/which page has
   been modified . This is because the VMs run on real hardware, and
   give no notifications to the VMM about page writes etc. THe page
   tables can be marked as read-only, but this case is prohibitively
   expensive and thus not considered , because we have set out to
   model a general,non-intrusive sharing mechanism.
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the expected number of comparisons is minimized, while keeping
the expected number of shared pages maximum. 
\section{Patterns}
\label{sec-9}
\subsection{Substrings}
\label{sec-9_1}

Assume there are 2 VMs with reasonably high sharing. As the previous analysis(TODO) showed, lot of sharing is `organized' neatly by page flags. In particular, if we discard for shared pages of the cached variety (page cache / slab etc) then most of the sharing is of pages mapped to same files on disk (program text sections etc), or same malloced pages (same applications creating the same `data'). 

In such scenarios the following assumption holds to a large degree:
Assume page number X of VM$_2$ is shared with X' of VM$_1$, Then with a high probability, X+1 will be shared with X`+1 .
Having given the explanation of the scenarios in which this holds true, we now give an experimental validation.

The main problem with the substring `peek' optimization is that it only is effective when the pages are shared for the first time. After that, KSM will do a stable tree search before comparing. 
Thus a lot of overhead is incurred even in low page-write/high sharing environments. Each stable tree search is a log(s) operation, and for S sharing pages, we have Slog(s). 

How to reduce this? The same trick can be used! If a page is a KSM page (testing for this is O(1), just check the flags), then we peek ahead anyway. If the peeked page is identical (one memcmp) and the rmap is stable, we're done! So even in this case we have reduced the operation to O(1) comparisons instead of log(s).

This can be combined with the previous page-cache rule.
I.E : page cache pages are only compared \textbf{once} (lookahead). If they dont match, dont touch them at all. 
How to implement this?. Need to atleast goto start of the file?
\subsubsection{Implementation}
\label{sec-9_1_1}

This lookahead heuristic was implemented in KSM. <See below for results>. 
We found that upto one third of comparisons can be eliminated.

Lookahead value.

Here is how the lookahead optimization works in the context of KSM. 
KSM default case : lookup$_{\mathrm{stable}}$ -> lookup$_{\mathrm{unstable}}$ -> insert$_{\mathrm{unstable}}$
Lookahead : lookahead -> insert$_{\mathrm{stable}}$-> KSM$_{\mathrm{default}}$.
The optimization does not incur any extra overhead in the case where the lookahead fails.

\section{Ideas}
\label{sec-11}
\subsection{Flags as fingerprints.}
\label{sec-11_1}

Question: can flags of a page serve as a fingerprint of its contents? Obviously flags by themselves have no meaning. But if we consider the flags of a physical page \textbf{over time}, then is there a case for ``identifying'' stable/unstable/volatile pages? FOr example, if the flags of a page have changed since the last scan then clearly there is a high probablility of its contents being changed. 
Ofcourse, a large number of page writes will not affect the flags : writes to anonymous pages by processes, pages mapped by the kernel for all the caches, etc.

One thing that the flags wont tell us is sharing \textbf{between} VMs, ala memory buddies. 
But in the same spirit as the previous argument, can a case be made about observing a history of page flags and predicting (very roughly) the page sharing potential between 2 VMs. Again note that a snapshot of the flags probably wont help at all. But a history of page flag changes etc might?

An optimization that comes to mind is to identify the `files' or memory regions based on the flags and compute checksums for the first few pages only. This can get messy since the first pages are likely to contain the same content anyway (magic numbers, environment variables etc?) and thus not be an effective
fingerprint. 
\subsection{Flags for adaptive scan-rate}
\label{sec-11_2}

The real irony of scanning based (particularly KSM) approach is that the overhead \textbf{increases} when the guest dirty-rate decreases. 
The reason is that when dirty rate is low, the number of volatile pages drops, which means everything is either in stable or unstable tree. If the sharing is low, then the unstable tree is very large. This implies log(U) comparisons \textbf{per page}. Overall the cost is:
cost(hash) + cost(search).

Walking down the unstable tree also has bad cache behaviour. <verify this!>

The scan-rate of any periodic scanner must be adaptive. One heuristic which can be used is the rate of change of page-flags over time for a particular VM.
If the flags havent changed much, then we can assume that the dirty-rate is under check. Ofcourse this is a big assumption which needs to be justified. 
Anyway, even if a wrong decision (scan/no-scan) is made, we can scan the memory region in the next round anyway.

KSM unstable tree question

Hello everyone .

I've been trying to understand how KSM works (i want to make some modifications / implement some optimizations) .
One thing that struck me odd was the high number of calls to remove$_{\mathrm{rmap}}$$_{\mathrm{item}}$$_{\mathrm{from}}$$_{\mathrm{tree}}$ .

Particularly, this instance in cmp$_{\mathrm{and}}$$_{\mathrm{merge}}$$_{\mathrm{page}}$ :

        /*
\begin{itemize}
\item As soon as we merge this page, we want to remove the
\item rmap$_{\mathrm{item}}$ of the page we have merged with from the unstable
\item tree, and insert it instead as new node in the stable tree.
\end{itemize}
         */
        if (kpage) \{
            remove$_{\mathrm{rmap}}$$_{\mathrm{item}}$$_{\mathrm{from}}$$_{\mathrm{tree}}$(tree$_{\mathrm{rmap}}$$_{\mathrm{item}}$);

            lock$_{\mathrm{page}}$(kpage);
            stable$_{\mathrm{node}}$ = stable$_{\mathrm{tree}}$$_{\mathrm{insert}}$(kpage);
            if (stable$_{\mathrm{node}}$) \{
                stable$_{\mathrm{tree}}$$_{\mathrm{append}}$(tree$_{\mathrm{rmap}}$$_{\mathrm{item}}$, stable$_{\mathrm{node}}$);
                stable$_{\mathrm{tree}}$$_{\mathrm{append}}$(rmap$_{\mathrm{item}}$, stable$_{\mathrm{node}}$);
            \}

Here, from i understand, we've found a match in the unstable tree, and are adding a stable node in the stable tree.
My question is: why do we need to remove the rmap$_{\mathrm{item}}$ from unstable tree here ? At the end of a scan we are erasing the unstable tree anyway. Also, all searches first consider the stable tree , and then the unstable tree.
What will happen if we find a match in the unstable tree, and simply update tree$_{\mathrm{rmap}}$$_{\mathrm{item}}$ to point to a stable$_{\mathrm{node}}$ ? 

Thanks for reading. I'd love to share the ideas i have for (attempting to) improve KSM, if anyone is intereseted.
